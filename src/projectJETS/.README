Project JETS is made up of 3 files:
	JetBuilder.java
	ArrayOfJets.java
	JetsMenu.java

JetBuilder.java

		Contains the variables necessary to build a jet. All the variables
		are defined privately to keep the user from changing them. A
		constructor was created to allow the user to build a jet. The file
		also consists of getters, setters, and a toString method to allow other
		parts of the program to set and then print the data.

		This file is the building block of the whole project.

ArrayOfJets.java

		File made to interact with the interface of this project. It comes
		with five hardcoded jets that are build-in the array 'jetArray' of
		size 100. The extra space in the array is for the user to make and
		store jets.

		A 'hanger' method is used to store the gets.
		A 'newJet' method is used to create a new jet and it relies on the
		the methods and constructors in the 'JetBuilder' object.
		Two additional methods - 'faster' & 'range'- are created to find
		the fastest jet and the jet with the longest range.

JetsMenu.java
		Builds the interface of the program which the user can interact with.
		The file contains a 'mainMenuOfJets' method and a main to allow java
		to run the program. The main call the method which prompts:
			1. List of all the Jets in the Hanger.
			2. Fastest jet in the hanger.
			3. Jets with the longest range.
			4. Add a new jet to the hangar.
			5. Exit.

		Picking option 1 call the 'hanger' method from the 'ArrayOfJets'. The
		second option calls the 'fastest' method. The third option calls the
		'range' method. The fourth option allows the user to input data to build and
		add a jet to the list of array if they wish to do so. Finally, option five
		allows the user to exit the program.
